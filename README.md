# IoT-based-Web-Controlled-Home-Automation-using-Raspberry-Pi

One of the good things about the Raspberry Pi is the great ability and ease with which it gives you the opportunity to connect devices to the internet especially for Home Automation Related Projects.  Today we are going to explore the possibility of controlling AC appliances with the click of buttons on a webpage using internet. Using this IoT based home automation system, you can control your Home appliances from anywhere in the world. This web server can be run from any device which can run HTML applications, like Smart Phone, tablet, computer etc.
# I. Hardware Requirements:

Raspberry Pi 3 (Any other Version will be nice)
Memory card 8 or 16GB running Raspbian Jessie
5v Relays
2n222 transistors
Diodes
Jumper Wires
Connection Blocks
LEDs to test.
AC lamp to Test
Breadboard and jumper cables
220 or 100 ohms resistor
II. Software Requirements:

Asides the Raspbian Jessie operating system running on the raspberry pi, we will also be using the WebIOPi frame work, notepad++ running on your PC and filezila to copy files from the PC to the raspberry pi, especially the web app files.

Also you dont need to code in Python for this Home Automation Project, WebIOPi will do all the work.
